## Why Use TypeScript with Next.js?

TypeScript helps catch errors at compile time, making your Next.js projects more robust and easier to maintain. It provides static typing, which improves development speed and code quality.

### Benefits of TypeScript

-   **Static typing**: Detect errors early in the development process.
-   **Improved IDE support**: Get better autocompletion and code suggestions.
-   **Scalability**: Easier to maintain as your app grows.

### Setting Up TypeScript

To add TypeScript to a Next.js project, simply run:

```bash
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/react @types/node
```
