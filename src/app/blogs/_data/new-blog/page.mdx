import data from "./data";

import HeroLayout from "@/components/hero/HeroLayout";

export const metadata = {
    title: "Blog - " + data.title,
};

Next.js and TypeScript are a powerful combination that can help you build more robust and maintainable web applications. In this guide, we'll explore how TypeScript integration works in Next.js and how you can leverage it effectively.

## Why TypeScript in Next.js?

TypeScript brings static typing to JavaScript, providing several key benefits:

-   Early error detection
-   Better IDE support with intelligent code completion
-   Improved code maintenance and refactoring
-   Enhanced team collaboration through clear interfaces

## Getting Started

Next.js has built-in TypeScript support, making it incredibly easy to get started. When creating a new Next.js project, you can enable TypeScript by simply adding a `tsconfig.json` file:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript
```

## Key TypeScript Features in Next.js

### 1. Page Components

TypeScript helps define proper types for your page components:

```typescript
import type { NextPage } from 'next'
import { GetStaticProps } from 'next'

interface HomeProps {
  posts: Post[]
}

const Home: NextPage<HomeProps> = ({ posts }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      {posts.map(post => (
        <article key={post.id}>{post.title}</article>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}

export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async () => {
  // Type-safe data fetching
  return {
    props: {
      posts: []
    }
  }
}

export default Home
```

### 2. API Routes

TypeScript provides type safety for API routes:

```typescript
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";

type Data = {
    message: string;
};

export default function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse<Data>) {
    res.status(200).json({ message: "Hello from Next.js!" });
}
```

### 3. Custom App Component

Type your custom App component for global configurations:

```typescript
import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}

export default MyApp
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Type Inference When Possible

TypeScript is smart enough to infer types in many cases:

```typescript
// Let TypeScript infer the type
const counter = useState(0); // inferred as number

// Explicit typing when needed
const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);
```

### 2. Create Type Definitions

Keep your types organized in separate files:

```typescript
// types/index.ts
export interface User {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    email: string;
}

export interface Post {
    id: string;
    title: string;
    content: string;
    author: User;
}
```

### 3. Utilize Path Aliases

Configure path aliases in `tsconfig.json` for better import organization:

```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "baseUrl": ".",
        "paths": {
            "@/components/*": ["components/*"],
            "@/lib/*": ["lib/*"]
        }
    }
}
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Any Type**: Avoid using `any` as it defeats the purpose of TypeScript. Use `unknown` if you need a type-safe alternative.

2. **Type Assertions**: Use type assertions sparingly. It's better to properly type your data structures:

```typescript
// Avoid
const user = data as User;

// Better
function isUser(data: unknown): data is User {
    return typeof data === "object" && data !== null && "id" in data && "name" in data;
}
```

3. **Implicit Any**: Enable `noImplicitAny` in your `tsconfig.json` to catch potential type issues early.

## Conclusion

TypeScript in Next.js provides a robust foundation for building type-safe applications. By following these patterns and best practices, you can create more maintainable and reliable web applications while catching errors before they reach production.

Remember that TypeScript is meant to help, not hinder. Start with basic typing and gradually add more type safety as your application grows. The investment in learning TypeScript will pay off in reduced bugs and improved development experience.
