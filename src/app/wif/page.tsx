                The Women in FOSS (Free and Open-Source Software) Community of IIT is an affinity
                group within the FOSS Community dedicated to advancing womenâ€™s involvement in free
                and open-source software development. We work to foster collaboration, provide
                resources, and empower women in the FOSS community. We strive to create an
                atmosphere of inclusion and support, promote research and development in FOSS, and
                provide access to mentorship and educational opportunities. Our community is open to
                everyone, regardless of gender identity, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual
                orientation, age, or disability. We believe that everyone has something valuable to
                contribute and that diversity of thought and experience is essential to the success
                of the community. We strive to create an environment of mutual respect and
                understanding where everyone can contribute and learn. The Women in FOSS Community
                provides a platform for members to learn about the open-source software ecosystem,
                acquire the skills to contribute to open-source projects and, take part in
                collaborations with other members of the community. We aim to encourage the
                participation of women in open source and to provide them with the resources and
                support they need to succeed. Through our initiatives, we hope to build a strong and
                vibrant community of Women in FOSS at IIT and beyond.
